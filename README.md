Sprint 1
======

Overview:
======
We have created a Java Project which completes all the requirements for the first sprint.

The requirements state the app should:
1.Display a blank map, i.e. a map with no armies on it.âœ”

2.Get the names of the two human players.âœ”

3.Allocate 9 territories to each of the two players and 6 territories to each of the 4 neutral players. âœ”
The allocation does not need to be random. Put one army on each territory.

4.Display the map showing the units.âœ”
